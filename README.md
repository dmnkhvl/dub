# Dub

To build this app I used [React](https://react.dev) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. 

## If you want to run app locally

1. Clone this repo to your local folder
2. Make sure to install the dependencies
```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```
